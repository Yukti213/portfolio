        <p>
        Hello! My name is Yukti, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc) degree in Web Designing at Kalindi College, University of Delhi.
         I am in my third year and deeply passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
          Along with honing my technical skills in web development, I enjoy exploring design trends and innovative ideas
         to craft engaging digital experiences. When I’m not coding or designing, I love indulging in creative hobbies like meme-making,
          which allows me to showcase my fun and artistic side.
